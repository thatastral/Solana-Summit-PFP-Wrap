# Quick Deployment Fix for Vercel

## The Problem
You got a "vite: command not found" error because Figma Make projects need additional configuration files to deploy to traditional hosting platforms like Vercel.

## The Solution
I've created all the necessary files for you:

### Files Created:
1. âœ… `package.json` - Lists all dependencies
2. âœ… `vite.config.ts` - Vite build configuration
3. âœ… `tsconfig.json` - TypeScript configuration
4. âœ… `index.html` - Entry HTML file
5. âœ… `src/main.tsx` - React entry point
6. âœ… `vite-plugin-figma-assets.ts` - Custom plugin to handle Figma assets
7. âœ… `.gitignore` - Ignore unnecessary files

## How to Deploy Now

### Step 1: Commit These New Files to GitHub

**Using GitHub Desktop:**
1. Open GitHub Desktop
2. You'll see all the new files listed (package.json, vite.config.ts, etc.)
3. Add a commit message: "Add Vercel deployment configuration"
4. Click **"Commit to main"**
5. Click **"Push origin"**

**Using Git Command Line:**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add Vercel deployment configuration"
git push origin main
```

### Step 2: Redeploy on Vercel

**Option A: Automatic (Recommended)**
- Vercel should automatically detect your GitHub push and start a new deployment
- Wait 2-3 minutes
- Check your Vercel dashboard for the deployment status

**Option B: Manual Trigger**
1. Go to your Vercel dashboard
2. Click on your project
3. Click **"Deployments"** tab
4. Click **"Redeploy"** on the latest deployment
5. Wait 2-3 minutes

### Step 3: Verify Build Settings (Important!)

In your Vercel project settings:

1. Go to **Settings** â†’ **General**
2. Verify these settings:
   - **Framework Preset:** Vite
   - **Build Command:** `npm run build`
   - **Output Directory:** `dist`
   - **Install Command:** `npm install`

## Environment Variables (Already Configured)

Your Supabase credentials are already in the code, so you don't need to add environment variables unless you want to use different credentials for production.

If you want to use environment variables instead:

1. Go to **Settings** â†’ **Environment Variables** in Vercel
2. Add:
   - `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` = `https://mguuhnletyvknpqziwjb.supabase.co`
   - `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` = (your anon key from info.tsx)

## Expected Build Process

When Vercel builds your project, you should see:
```
âœ“ Installing dependencies...
âœ“ Running "npm run build"
âœ“ Vite bundling React app
âœ“ Build completed
âœ“ Deployment ready
```

## Troubleshooting

### If build still fails:

1. **Check the build logs** in Vercel for specific errors
2. **Verify all files were pushed** to GitHub (check your repo)
3. **Clear Vercel cache**:
   - Settings â†’ General â†’ scroll down
   - Click "Clear Cache"
   - Redeploy

### If you get "Module not found" errors:

Make sure these files exist in your GitHub repo:
- `package.json`
- `vite.config.ts`
- `index.html`
- `src/main.tsx`

### Contact Support

If you still have issues:
1. Share the full build log from Vercel
2. Verify the file structure in your GitHub repo matches the project
3. Check that all new files were committed and pushed

## Summary

âœ… **What I Fixed:**
- Created `package.json` with all dependencies
- Created Vite configuration for building
- Created entry files for React
- Created custom plugin to handle Figma asset imports
- Updated deployment guide with correct settings

ðŸš€ **Next Steps:**
1. Push new files to GitHub
2. Wait for Vercel to rebuild automatically
3. Your site should deploy successfully!

**Your site will be live at:** `https://your-project-name.vercel.app`
