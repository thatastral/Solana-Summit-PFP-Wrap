# Audio Setup Instructions

To enable background music on your Solana Summit landing page:

1. Place your audio file `SSummitSong.mp3` in this `/public` folder
2. The file should be named exactly: `SSummitSong.mp3`
3. Supported formats: MP3, WAV, OGG

The audio will:
- Play automatically at 70% volume when the page loads
- Loop continuously
- Can be toggled on/off using the audio button in the top-right corner

**Note:** Some browsers may block autoplay. If this happens, the audio will start playing on the first user click anywhere on the page.
